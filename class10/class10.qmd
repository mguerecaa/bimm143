# The PDB database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures - the PDB.

Get a CSV file from the PDB database and read it into R.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. **Answer:** 84.54% (X-Ray) and 8.72% (EM).

My pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems. Let's see:

```{r}
# pdbstats$X.ray
#the numbers are strings

```

We found a function called `gsub()` now we can figure out how it works.

I can thurn this snipet tinos a function that I casin use for every column in the tabel.

```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

```

Apply across all columns

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
```

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein? **Answer:** 0.086

```{r}
round(215684/249751891 * 100, 3)
```

# 2. Visualizing Protein Structure

We will learn the basics of Mol*(mol-star) homepage: https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will play with the PDB code 1HSG.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure? 

**Answer:** There is no visible hydrogen in this pdb file because it is such a small atom.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have. 

**Answer:** HOH 308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Show 1HSG:

Show the ASP25 amino acids:

## Back to R and owrking with PDB structures

Predict the dynamics (flexibility) of an important protein:

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```
Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? **Answer:** 198

Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? **Answer:** HOH and MK1

Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? **Answer:** 2

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```
Here we will do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict fucntional motions of a kinase protein.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called trajectory of the predicted motions:

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then I can open this file in Mol*....
